# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** n8n Workflow Generator (AI-Powered Automation Builder)
**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
**Author:** Product Management Team
**Date:** January 2024
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Vision:**
Empower anyone to build and deploy production-ready n8n workflows using natural languageâ€”no code, no friction.

**Problem:**
Creating workflows in n8n today is manual, slow, and requires technical knowledge. Non-technical users are blocked, and technical users waste time on repetitive tasks.

**Solution:**
A micro-SaaS that converts plain English descriptions into importable n8n workflows via Claude's API. The generated workflows include embedded documentation, error handling, and are ready for deployment.

    A[Homepage] --> B[Start Chat]
    B --> C[Describe Automation]
    C --> D[AI Workflow Generation]
    D --> E[Preview Workflow]
    E --> F{Choose Output}
    F -->|Download JSON| G[Manual Import]
    F -->|Connect n8n| H[Auto-Deploy]
    H --> I[Workflow Created in n8n]
```

### Stages

1. **Discovery**

   * Landing page explains benefits and includes demo
   * Clear CTA to "Start Building"

2. **Engagement**

   * User enters workflow goal in chat
   * AI responds with questions (if needed) for clarification

3. **Generation**

   * Claude API returns generated workflow
   * Workflow displayed with summary and preview

4. **Output Options**

   * **Download JSON**: Save and manually import to n8n
   * **Connect n8n**: Use OAuth/API key for auto-deployment

5. **Deployment**

   * One-click deploy to user's n8n instance
   * User redirected to activate and connect credentials

---

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Integration with Claude API

* Prompt engineering and parsing of natural language
* Workflow generation must include:

  * Nodes
  * Connections
  * Settings
  * Documentation
  * Required credentials

### n8n Deployment API

**Auth Support:**

* OAuth 2.0 for n8n cloud
* API key support for self-hosted users

**Workflow Deployment Logic (Pseudocode):**

```javascript
// Deploy workflow to n8n instance
async function deployToN8n(workflow, creds) {
  const client = await authenticate(creds);
  const response = await client.createWorkflow({...});
  for (const cred of workflow.requiredCredentials) {
    await client.createCredentialPlaceholder({...});
  }
  return { id: response.id, url: `${creds.instanceUrl}/workflow/${response.id}` };
}
```

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement     | Detail                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance     | Workflow generated in under 10 seconds                         |
| Security        | OAuth/API key encryption; no credential storage on our servers |
| Availability    | 99% uptime for generation and deployment endpoints             |
| Compatibility   | Must support latest stable version of n8n                      |
| Maintainability | Workflows versioned internally for rollback                    |
